# System specifications for a deep learning/machine learning project:

With a variety of CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs, choosing the right hardware may get a little confusing. Most common deep learning libraries take advantage of multi-threading, gpu based parallelization.
1) Processing power:
2) Hardware compatibility:
3) Power efficiency:
4) Thermal management:
5) Number of Cores and Threads: 

a)
# At my company we run backpropagation (which is the computationally demanding part of machine learning) on everything
# from $3000 Dell Precision M6800 laptops with 8 CPU cores, 24GB ram, and 1500 GPU cores, to $8000 servers with 32 CPU cores, 128GB ram and 5000 GPU cores.

b) Nvidia DGX-1: offers more versatility and flexibility in terms of its hardware and software configurations. It also offers more memory and storage capacity, which could be particularly useful for large-scale research projects.
c) Google Colab offers 12 GB RAM and 107 GB HDD online

If your tasks are small and can fit in a complex sequential processing, you don’t need a big system. You could even skip the GPUs altogether. A CPU such as i7–7500U can train an average of ~115 examples/second. However,if 
your task is a bit intensive, and has a manageable data, a reasonably powerful GPU would be a better choice for you. Nvidia GTX 1080 (8 GB VRAM), can train an average of ~14k examples/second. 

Furthermore, a GPU can perform convolutional/CNN or recurrent neural networks/RNN based operations. It can also perform operations on a batch of images of 128 or 256 images at once in just a few milliseconds. 
However, the power consumption is around ~250 W and requires a full PC that additionally requires 150 W of power, which leads to a total of 400W.

Here are some key insights into these hardware trends:

a) Specialized Accelerators: Machine learning workloads are becoming increasingly complex, demanding specialized hardware accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). 
These chips are designed to handle the massive matrix operations inherent to deep learning models, dramatically speeding up training and inference tasks.

b) Edge AI:  This trend reduces latency, enhances privacy, and allows for real-time processing in applications like autonomous vehicles, IoT devices, and smartphones. 
Hardware designs are adapting to support power-efficient AI inference at the edge.

c) Custom Hardware: As machine learning models become increasingly diverse, custom hardware solutions are emerging. Companies are developing Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
tailored for specific deep learning tasks, achieving higher performance and energy efficiency.

d) Memory and Storage: Machine learning models are getting larger, requiring more memory and storage capacity. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) and solid-state drives (SSDs) 
are becoming critical for training and running these models efficiently.
